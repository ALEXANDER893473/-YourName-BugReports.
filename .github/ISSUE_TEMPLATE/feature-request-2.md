Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
I often find it challenging to keep track of my tasks and deadlines efficiently using the current task management feature in our project management tool. The lack of customizable views makes it difficult to organize tasks according to priority or project, leading to confusion and inefficiency in managing my workload.

#### Describe the solution you'd like
I would like to see a new feature that allows users to create customizable task views based on their specific needs. This feature should enable users to filter and sort tasks by various criteria such as priority, due date, project, assignee, and status. Additionally, users should be able to save and name these custom views for quick access.

#### Describe alternatives you've considered
One alternative could be to rely on external task management tools that offer more robust customization options. However, integrating multiple tools adds complexity and may lead to fragmentation of project data. Another alternative could be to manually organize tasks using tags or labels within the existing system, but this workaround is cumbersome and prone to human error.

#### Additional context
As a project manager, I often need to switch between different project views to monitor progress and allocate resources effectively. Having the ability to create and save custom task views would significantly improve my workflow and productivity. I've attached a mockup of how I envision this feature to look like for reference.
